<h1>Biography</h1>
<br>
Wei Xue is currently an Assistant Professor at Division of Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas (EMIA), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). He is also a founding member of Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre (HKGAI). He received the Bachelor degree in automatic control from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2010, and the Ph.D degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015. From August 2015 to September 2018 he was first a Marie Curie Experienced Researcher and then a Research Associate in Speech and Audio Processing Group, Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK. He was a Senior Research Scientist at JD AI Research, Beijing, from November 2018 to December 2021, where he was leading the R&D on front-end speech processing and acoustic modelling for robust speech recognition. From January 2022 to April 2023 he was an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer Sciences, Hong Kong Baptist University. He was a visiting scholar at Université de Toulon and KU Leuven. Wei's research interests are in speech and music intelligence, including AI music generation, speech enhancement and separation, room acoustics, as well as speech and audio event recognition. He was a former Marie Curie Fellow and was selected into the Beijing Overseas Talent Aggregation Project.<br><br>

<s><font color="red"> We are hiring self-motivated PhD students (2025 Fall), RAs (anytime) and postdocs (anytime) to work on artificial creativity and human-machine interaction for AI music and digital humanities applications, speech processing and room acoustics. Remote collaborators are also welcome. Please email me (weixue@ust.hk) if you are interested.</font></s>
<br><br>
Due to the large amount of emails, I may not be able to reply to all of them. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The PhD/RA candidate list for 2024 Fall and 2025 Spring/Fall enrollments is provisionally full. Postdoc and Algorithm Engineer positions are still open.<br><br>
